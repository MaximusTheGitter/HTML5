                      Superlap Shootout gives the top 5 entrants in each class one extra session to clench that spot on the podium. Set in the dying <br>
                      stages of Day 2, the fastest five cars from each class will be assembled in pit lane and then sent out for a three lap flyer <br>
                      consisting of a warm up or sighting lap, one attack lap, and one cool down lap. It is common knowledge that the track is faster <br>
                      in the cooler periods of the day so this is the time we can expect to see records tumble. With a clean, clear track you can <br>
                      expect the entrants to have everything set on “max” as they go for one last ditch attempt with the sun setting behind them. <br>
                      Expect flames, sparks and glowing brake rotors as the boost is turned right up in one big grand finale that will be heaven <br>
                      for photographers and fans alike.

                  <h3>Superlap Shootout FAQs</h3>
                  <h5>When and where will the Superlap Shootout take place?</h5>
                  <p>
                      After the final Pro Class Session on Saturday (Day 2), at approximately 5:15pm. <br>
                      The finalists will be using the same circuit (GP Circuit).
                  </p>
                  <h5>Who will compete in the Superlap Shootout?</h5>
                  <p>
                      To be eligible for the shootout, the team will need to be in the top 5 of their particular class at end of the last official <br>
                      session on Saturday. If a competitor cannot compete due to mechanical failure then the next fastest competitor <br>
                      will be allocated their position
                  </p>
                  <h5>Does the winner of the Superlap Shootout also automatically win the World Time Attack Challenge?</h5>
                  <p>
                      No. The fastest time recorded during the entire event always wins the World Time Attack Challenge. <br>
                      However, since only the five fastest cars in each class are competing, there is a good chance that the <br>
                      winning lap time will be set during the Superlap Shootout. One thing that will definitely be decided <br>
                      during the Superlap Shootout is the podium order.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Why are the teams likely to set their fastest lap time during the Superlap Shootout?</h5>
                  <p>
                      Three reasons; 1. they will be competing on a cool and clean track, 2. no traffic – since there are only 5 <br>
                      cars in each group each car will have a traffic-free hot lap – ideal for maximum attack, 3. because their best <br>
                      time from Friday and Saturday still counts, each team can only improve their podium chances, <br>
                      there will be NOTHING holding them back during this final assault.
